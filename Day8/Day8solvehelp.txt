Advent Of Code – Day 8: “Handheld Halting”
DECEMBER 8, 2020 / PESSE
I never ran and debugged an infinite loop of program consisting of the instructions nop, jmp and acc in SQL before – but it’s possible and the Day 8 puzzle gives me the possibility to do so.

Each of the commands has a possible value, and while we ignore it for nop, acc manipulates a global variable and jmp redirects the program to a different line.

To solve this in SQL we need recursive subqueries again. With a bit of case we can easily determine the next line number to be exectued, but how to we prevent the infinite loop from running?

My solution was to add a stack-column which holds all the previously called lines. With that I can check whether a line has already been called.
I use a “:” suffix and prefix, because when I check for “42” it will find that number in “142”, too, but “:42:” will not be found.

        aoc_file_loader.local_url('day_8_input.txt')

Part 2 gets a bit more complicated now, because we need to find the single nop or jmp command that leads to the infinite loop – and replace it.

Because we have the power of computers (and modern computers are immensely powerful calcualation machines), we brute-force the solution by running all the variants in which we replace one command.

We can achieve that by cross-joining a variant_definition table which contains all the nop or jmp commands and the replacement commands.

To find the correct one, we look for the one variant that has NumberOfLines+1 as the maximum next value, because that means the program reached its end.

That was challenging and very fun!
